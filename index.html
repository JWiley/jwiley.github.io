	<p>Joshua Wiley, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral research fellow in
	  the Centre for Primary Care and Prevention at
	  the
	<a href = "http://mmihr.acu.edu.au/">Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research</a>
	and a senior analyst at <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
title="Private data science and for-hire statistical consulting company">
	  Elkhart Group Ltd.</span> Trained as a health psychologist,
	his research focuses on understanding the complex interplays of
	psychological, social, and physiological processes as they
	pertain to psychological and physical health.  His passion to
	integrate across mind and body has lead to involvement in a
	number of interdisciplinary collaborations with nearly 20
	publications including 16 peer reviewed journal articles, two
	other publications and one book.
	A defining theme across Joshua's research that merges
	his substantive and statistical background is taking a systems
	approach to studying health that acknowledges the unique and
	interactive effects of behavioral/psychosocial processes along
	with structural and physiological ones.  Joshua is
	particularly interested in research projects that move beyond
	testing simple associations to testing more comprehensive
	models of health as well as research that investigates health
	trajectories and their predictors.
	</p>

	<p>In statistics and data science, Joshua focuses on
	biostatistics, and is interested in reproducible research and
	graphical displays of data and statistical models.  Through
	consulting at Elkhart Group Ltd. and former work
	at <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
	title="University of California, Los Angeles">
	UCLA</span> Statistical Consulting
	Group, he has supported a wide array of clients ranging from
	graduate students, to experienced researchers, and
	biotechnology companies.

	  <h4>Psychosocial Resources &amp; Coping</h4>
	  <p>I am fascinated by the individual differences in how
	  people react to and cope with stressful events.  This has
	  led me to explore the roles of psychosocial resources:
	  psychological and social factors that are innately valuable
	  or that individuals can draw on to promote good mental or
	  physical health.  Specific resources I have studied include
	  social support, self-efficacy, and positive outcome
	  expectancies.  Given the degree of measurement overlap of
	  many resources, another line of my research has been
	  examining measurement and factor analytic models of
	  constellations of psychosocial resources.  In four samples
	  analyzed so far, a two-factor model with a latent
	  psychological and social resource factor has fit well.</p>

	  <p>Coping strategies people employ in response to stressors
	  also play a role in how well they adjust.  Coping is
	  particularly important in the face of major life stressors
	  such as cancer or chronic disease.  In collaboration with the
	  UCLA <a href="http://stantonlab.psych.ucla.edu/">Stanton
	  Stress and Coping</a> lab, I have studied the effects of
	  coping in response to genetic testing, breast cancer
	  diagnosis, and an experimental study of receipt of negative
	  health information.</p>

	  <h4>Biomarkers</h4>
	  <p>To understand how psychological and physiological
	  processes interact, I have worked on studies measuring
	  biomarkers such as salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase to
	  assess <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
title="Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal">
	  HPA</span> axis and sympathetic nervous system reactivity
	  to stress, and whether psychosocial resources predict
	  physiological baseline or reactivity to acute stress.

	  I collaborate with researchers at Monash University, 
	  Stanford, and the University of Melbourne processes related
	  to sleep, including the roles of cognitive vulnerabilities
	  in self- and <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
          title="assessed using actimetry sensors that measure motor
	  activity typically on the wrist">actigraphy</span>-assessed
	  sleep, and the effects of variability in sleep.</p>

	  <p>As the number of biomarkers available has grown,
	  researchers are increasingly faced with how to choose which
	  to collect or if many are collected how to model them.
	  Given my work exploring measurement models of psychosocial
	  resources, I am interested in applying similar approaches
	  to biomarkers.  I am particularly interested in practical
	  analytical models researchers can use not only to reduce
	  the number of dimensions of biomarkers for analysis, but
	  also to find theoretically meaningful dimensions.  Related
	  questions include how best to utilize repeated measures of
	  biomarkers, issues of non-normality or non-linearity, and
	  adjusting for potential biasing effects of medications and
	  other measurement error.</p>

	  <h4>Other</h4>
	  <p>I actively collaborate on interdisciplinary teams.
	    In the area of health services, I have engaged in research
	    probing the frequency and cost of providing <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
	    title="treatment that will not achieve an outcome that the patient can meaningfully appreciate">
	    futile care</span> in critical care units. We also
	    investigated predictors of providing care assessed 
	    as futile: what characteristics of patients or providers
	    increases the probability that a patient will receive
	    futile care?  Do different types of providers such as
	    attending physicians, fellows, and nurses ahve different
	    perceptions of when or for which patients, care is
	    futile?</p>
	  <p>A separate line of work has involved modeling and
	    understanding psychiatric conditions in children and
	    adolescents.  Projects have included scale design and
	    assessment of anxiety in children as well as 
	    analysis of behavioral and <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
            title="electroencephalography">EEG</span> patterns that are
	    signatures of <span data-tooltip class="has-tip" 
            title="attention deficit hyperactivity
	    disorder">ADHD</span>.  In the ADHD research I am involved
	    in, we have tried to characterize differences in
	    networks between children with and without ADHD, rather
	    than only looking at differences on single measures.
	    Most recently, I am involved in a project pursuing novel,
	    interactive, behavioral measures of ADHD.</p>

	  <h4>Measurement Models</h4>
	  <p>Deriving unbiased, reliable measures is a common problem
	  in psychology where core constructs such as depression and
	  personality are unobservable.  I integrate psychometrics and
	  item response theory into my work to create latent variables
	  of focal constructs and to explore their accuracy and
	  reliability of these measures.  I have used confirmatory
	  factor models to understand the latent factor structure
	  underlying psychosocial resources (Wiley, ..., Stanton,
	  under review) and bi-factor models to separate variability
	  associated with anxiety from multiple reporters (parent and
	  child) in categorical response data.  Although most of work
	  employs maximum likelihood methods, I am also interested in
	  Bayesian methods.  In one study, I used Bayesian factor
	  analysis to extract multiple draws of factor scores from the
	  posterior distribution of the latent variable to
	  meta-analyze several samples where the latent construct was
	  assumed similar, but the specific indicators varied (Wiley,
	  ..., Stanton, under review).  I am also exploring the use
	  of Bayesian factor analysis with strong priors to allow
	  small covariances among residuals.  I use a variety of 
	  analytical software including the commercial 
	    <a href="https://www.statmodel.com/"><code>Mplus</code></a> as well
	  as open source variants such as 
	    <a href="http://openmx.psyc.virginia.edu/"><code>OpenMx</code></a> and 
	    <a href="http://lavaan.ugent.be/"><code>lavaan</code></a>.  For
	  Bayesian models, I have used both <a href="https://www.statmodel.com/"><code>Mplus</code></a> and coded my own
	  factor models in <a href="http://mc-stan.org/"><code>Stan</code></a>.  I
	  have also written a small number of utility functions
	  related to measurement models such as getting maximum
	  likelihood estimates of descriptive statistics using all
	  available data in the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>
	  package <a href="https://github.com/JWiley/semutils"><code>semutils</code></a> available on
	  github, and I am a co-developer of the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>
	  package <a href="https://github.com/michaelhallquist/MplusAutomation"><code>MplusAutomation</code></a> to link <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>
	  and <a href="https://www.statmodel.com/"><code>Mplus</code></a>,

	  <h4>Mixed Effects Models</h4>
	  <p>Another focus of my statistics work is on mixed and
	  random effects models (e.g., patients sampled within
	  physicians; longitudinal observational studies).  One
	  project I worked on involved observations crossed between
	  patients (repeated measures) and physicians and the outcome
	  was ordinal (Huynh, Kleerup, Wiley, ..., Wenger, 2013).
	  I analyzed the data in a Bayesian framework and presented
	  the average marginal change in the probability of falling
	  into each level of the outcome as an intuitive way for
	  clinicians to understand the results and effect of each
	  variable.  To automate generating average marginal
	  predictions following an ordinal, cross-classified Bayesian
	  mixed effects model, I wrote the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>
	  package, <a href="https://github.com/JWiley/postMCMCglmm"><code>postMCMCglmm</code></a>,
	  available on github and presented a poster on the work at
	  Modern Modeling Methods 2013 meeting.</p>
	  <h4>Missing Data</h4>
	  <p>I have expertise using multiple imputation and maximum
	  likelihood approaches to more efficiently use data in the
	  case they are missing completely at random (MCAR) or at
	  least missing at random (MAR).  However, in longitudinal
	  studies, attrition is ubiquitous and assuming this is
	  random is often untenable.  I have done work using joint
	  models or so-called shared parameter models where the
	  random intercept and slope parameters from a growth model
	  are used as predictors of the probability of still being in
	  the study (Wiley, ..., Stanton, in preparation).  I have
	  also used joint models in work with clients where the
	  outcome was one of the decision criteria for whether
	  participants could remain in the study (i.e., non random as
	  participants who worsened too quickly were triaged out of
	  the study).</p>

	  <h4>Intra-individual Variability</h4>
	  <p>I am currently working on developing methods for
	  analyzing and modeling intra-individual variability.  I have
	  developed an 
	  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>, 
	  <a href="https://github.com/ElkhartGroup/varian"><code>varian</code></a>,
	  for
	  conducting <strong>vari</strong>ability <strong>an</strong>alyis.
	  Currently I am working on extending the software to allow
	  more flexible models, alternative distributions, and to use
	  variability as both a predictor and as an outcome (or both,
	  as in mediation).
	  In collaboration with other researchers, we are also working
	  on publishing a number of empirical papers exploring the
	  effects of variability.</p>

	  <h4>Current and Future Directions</h4>
	  <p>Areas of current interest include models and tests for
	  multilevel mediation.  In my work and consultation, I have
	  used a non-parametric two-stage re-sampling bootstrap
	  approach as well as a fully Bayesian model derive confidence
	  intervals around the indirect effect.  I have conducted some
	  small simulations examining the properties of two-stage
	  re-sampling for multilevel models and code to make use of
	  multiple processors or clusters to speed non parametric
	  bootstrapping of multilevel models
	  in  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>. Easy
	  to use, fast, tools for applied research using multilevel
	  mediation models is an active area of interest. I
	  am also interested in techniques to estimate the
	  distribution of indirect effects when one of the pathways is
	  a random effect and in how this information can be presented
	  to be useful to researchers, rather than marginalizing out
	  individual differences.</p>
