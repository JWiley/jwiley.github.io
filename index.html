	  <p>Joshua Wiley is a lecturer in the
	    <a href = "http://www.monash.edu/neuro-institute">Monash
	      Institute of Cognitive and Clinical Neurosciences</a> and
	    School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University.  He
	    completed his PhD at the University of California at Los
	    Angeles in Psychology with a major in health psychology
	    research, and did a post doc in primary care and
	    prevention research with a focus on pragmatic randomized
	    controlled trials.
	    

	    He studies the roles of risk and protective factors in the
	    psychological and behavioral response to stress and
	    chronic disease.  Specifically, his interests are in
	    sleep and affective science and understanding the
	    protective role of emotion regulation factors including
	    psychosocial resources (e.g., optimism, social support)
	    and approach and avoidance-oriented coping processes.  He
	    studies whether and how these factors promote adjustment
	    and health to stressful experiences. Examples
	    of questions his research addresses are:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>What are the trajectories of sleep and mental
		health in response to stress and are these predicted
		by resources or coping strategies? </li>
	      <li>Do psychological and behavioral processes move in
		synchrony or co-regulate?</li>
	      <li>What are the mechanisms and causal chains linking
	      risk and protective factors with psychological and
	      physical health?</li>
	      <li>What are the characteristics of people who are
		resilient to or recover quickly from adverse
		events?</li>
	    </ol>

    	  <!-- <h4>Psychosocial Resources &amp; Coping</h4> -->
    	  <!-- <p>I am fascinated by the individual differences in how -->
    	  <!-- people react to and cope with stressful events.  This has -->
    	  <!-- led me to explore the roles of psychosocial resources: -->
    	  <!-- psychological and social factors that are innately valuable -->
    	  <!-- or that individuals can draw on to promote good mental or -->
    	  <!-- physical health.  Specific resources I have studied include -->
    	  <!-- social support, self-efficacy, and positive outcome -->
    	  <!-- expectancies.  Given the degree of measurement overlap of -->
    	  <!-- many resources, another line of my research has been -->
    	  <!-- examining measurement and factor analytic models of -->
    	  <!-- constellations of psychosocial resources.  In four samples -->
    	  <!-- analyzed so far, a two-factor model with a latent -->
    	  <!-- psychological and social resource factor has fit well.</p> -->
    	  <!-- <p>Coping strategies people employ in response to stressors -->
    	  <!-- also play a role in how well they adjust.  Coping is -->
    	  <!-- particularly important in the face of major life stressors -->
    	  <!-- such as cancer or chronic disease.  In collaboration with the -->
    	  <!-- UCLA <a href="http://stantonlab.psych.ucla.edu/">Stanton -->
    	  <!-- Stress and Coping</a> lab, I have studied the effects of -->
    	  <!-- coping in response to genetic testing, breast cancer -->
    	  <!-- diagnosis, and an experimental study of receipt of negative -->
    	  <!-- health information.</p> -->

<!-- 	  <h4>Biomarkers</h4> -->
<!-- 	  <p>To understand how psychological and physiological -->
<!-- 	  processes interact, I have worked on studies measuring -->
<!-- 	  biomarkers such as salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase to -->
<!-- 	  assess <span data-tooltip class="has-tip"  -->
<!-- title="Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal"> -->
<!-- 	  HPA</span> axis and sympathetic nervous system reactivity -->
<!-- 	  to stress, and whether psychosocial resources predict -->
<!-- 	  physiological baseline or reactivity to acute stress. -->

<!-- 	  I collaborate with researchers at Monash University,  -->
<!-- 	  Stanford, and the University of Melbourne processes related -->
<!-- 	  to sleep, including the roles of cognitive vulnerabilities -->
<!-- 	  in self- and <span data-tooltip class="has-tip"  -->
<!--           title="assessed using actimetry sensors that measure motor -->
<!-- 	  activity typically on the wrist">actigraphy</span>-assessed -->
<!-- 	  sleep, and the effects of variability in sleep.</p> -->

<!-- 	  <p>As the number of biomarkers available has grown, -->
<!-- 	  researchers are increasingly faced with how to choose which -->
<!-- 	  to collect or if many are collected how to model them. -->
<!-- 	  Given my work exploring measurement models of psychosocial -->
<!-- 	  resources, I am interested in applying similar approaches -->
<!-- 	  to biomarkers.  I am particularly interested in practical -->
<!-- 	  analytical models researchers can use not only to reduce -->
<!-- 	  the number of dimensions of biomarkers for analysis, but -->
<!-- 	  also to find theoretically meaningful dimensions.  Related -->
<!-- 	  questions include how best to utilize repeated measures of -->
<!-- 	  biomarkers, issues of non-normality or non-linearity, and -->
<!-- 	  adjusting for potential biasing effects of medications and -->
<!-- 	  other measurement error.</p> -->

    <!-- 	  <p>I actively collaborate on interdisciplinary teams. -->
    <!-- 	    In the area of health services, I have engaged in research -->
    <!-- 	    probing the frequency and cost of providing <span data-tooltip class="has-tip"  -->
